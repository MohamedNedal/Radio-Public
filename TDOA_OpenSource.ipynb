    "The methodology is described in Badman+[2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...95B/abstract). At its core, the procedure is quite simple. Assuming we have three spacecraft (e.g. A, B and C) located approximately co-planar (e.g. in the ecliptic plane) at 2D positions $(x,y)_{i={A,B,C}}$ which all receive the same radio signal at a given frequency $f$ at times $t_{i={A,B,C}}$, we can map these positions (assuming the radio source also is approximately co-planar) to a source origin position $(x_s(f),y_s(f))$ via an analytic construction which essentially corresponds to intersecting two hyperbolae where the locations of the geometric foci are set by the positions of pairs of the spacecraft, and the hyperbola curvature are set by the time __delay__ of the measurement between those same two spacecraft  (see figure 11 in Badman+[2022](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...95B/abstract) ).\n",

    "* Produce the position vectors of the individual spacecraft at the time of interest.\n",
    "* Process the spectrograms to perform feature extraction of the feature of interest, resulting in a 1d curve f=f(t).\n",
    "* Use the extracted feature from all three spacecraft and iterate the analytical procedure as function fo frequency to derive the source position as a function of frequency."
